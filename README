The aim of this project is to demonstrate use of algorithms minimax and alpha-beta.

Modules :
* connect4 : main module wich implements the game connect4
* minimax-tools : set of classes used by some players to implements minimax and alphabeta
* players-test : module to test players (deprecated)
* players : example of player implementations
* ui : swing ui to player with player or use tournament mode

There are tow other projects in branches connect4-player and connect4-player-solution to learn how implements algorithms and heuristic like a work practice and its solution.
